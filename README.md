BitBox
======

BitBox is a web frontend for BitTorrent Sync.  BitBox allows you to share your btsync content on the web, using custom links.  

BitBox uses selective syncing, so only the files you're sharing are downloaded to your disk.  You can easily share files from multiple BitTorrent Sync folders.

-----
##Installation##
BitBox is a CodeIgniter web application.

In order to use BitBox, you'll need a [BitTorrent Sync API key](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/developers).  

Begin by configuring BTSync on your computer.  You'll need to enable the API with your API key, and confirm that the BTSync client is accessible via the web (port 8888).
